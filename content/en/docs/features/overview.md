## Secured Onboarding of Devices

The plgd system incorporates a Secured Onboarding of Devices feature that guarantees a secure and dependable procedure for incorporating devices into the system. This functionality encompasses various tasks such as overseeing device identity certificates, integrating with root certification authorities, and generating and providing per device chain of trust certificates. In line with the [OCF specifications](https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/), the system relies on X.509 certificates for device identity and authentication purposes.
