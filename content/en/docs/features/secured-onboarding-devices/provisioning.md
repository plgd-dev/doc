## Zero-touch Provisioning

DPS allows for effortless provisioning of devices to a single IoT solution without the need to hardcode IoT Hub connection information at the factory. This simplifies the initial setup process.

## Load Balancing

With DPS, devices can be effectively load-balanced across multiple IoT hubs. This feature ensures optimal distribution of device connections and provides scalability for large-scale deployments.

## Multitenancy Support

Using sales transaction data, DPS enables devices to connect to their respective owner's IoT solution. This capability facilitates multitenancy scenarios, allowing secure and isolated device connections.

## Solution Isolation

DPS enables devices to connect to specific IoT solutions based on use-case requirements. This feature ensures solution isolation, enhancing security and enabling tailored configurations for different applications.

## Geo-sharding

By leveraging DPS, devices can be connected to the IoT Hub with the lowest latency. This geo-sharding capability improves performance by minimizing network latency and optimizing data transmission.

## Reprovisioning

DPS supports reprovisioning based on changes in device configurations or when a device loses the capability to connect to the IoT Hub. This feature ensures continuous connectivity and allows for seamless updates.

## Key Rolling

For devices not using X.509 certificates for connection, DPS facilitates rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub. This capability enhances security by regularly refreshing authentication credentials.

## Zero Trust Environment

In a Zero Trust Environment, the Device Provisioning Service Certificate is available at the device. This means that devices undergo validation and verification processes to establish trust before being granted access to the system. The Zero Trust approach ensures a high level of security by validating each device's identity and authorization.

## Time Synchronization

DPS includes the ability to synchronize device time according to the Device Provisioning Service. This feature ensures accurate timekeeping across connected devices, aiding in synchronization and data analysis.
