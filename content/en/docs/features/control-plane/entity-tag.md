An entity-tag (ETAG) is used to identify changes of the resource that happen over time. ETAG is generated by the resource server, in our case device, using various methods such as a version, checksum, hash or a timestamp. When the client retrieves an entity-tag, it should treat it as an opaque value without making any assumptions about its content or structure. In CoAP, the ETAG is part of the [CoAP options](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7252#section-5.4) and is used to detect changes in resources. It is used to optimize the client processing time of the response from the device in case no change was detected - the ETAG wasn't changed from the last request.

For more information about ETAG, refer to the [RFC7252 Section 5.10.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7252#section-5.10.6).

## IoTivity-lite

### Definitions

- **ETAG**: An ETAG is an 8-byte opaque value that represents the state of a resource. It is generated by the device and used to detect changes in resources.
- **Global ETAG**: The Global ETAG is the highest ETAG value generated among all resources in the device. It is used to generate the next ETAG when a resource is created or modified.
- **Collision**: A collision happens when a client has a cached resource with a specific ETAG value, but the device has a same ETAG associated with the different resource state. Collisions can occur when there is a lack of synchronization of the device's time.
- **Random number**: A number within the range of 1 to 1000.

### ETAG Generation Algorithm

In IoTivity-lite, the ETAG is generated using the following algorithm:

1. Obtain the current time and the current global ETAG value.
2. If the current time exceeds the global ETAG value, update the global ETAG value with the current time.
3. Generate a random number and add it to the global ETAG value to obtain the new resource ETAG for the modified resource.
4. Assign the generated ETAG from step 3. to the modified resource as its new ETAG value.

By following this algorithm, the ETAG is always **increasing and unique for each changed resource among all resources in the device**.

When handling load operations, the global ETAG value is determined by taking the maximum value among all existing ETAGs, combining it with the current time, and adding a random number (refer to `oc_etag_load_and_clear`). The inclusion of the time component serves to minimize potential collisions between the ETAGs of device resources and the cached ETAGs stored in clients. Additionally, the introduction of a random number introduces an element of uncertainty to the ETAG, particularly in cases where time synchronization is not precise.

**Collision example**: Consider a device that always sets the time to 1.1.1970 due to the lack of a real-time clock. This device has only one modifiable resource. Let's say the device is running with an updated resource that has an ETAG value of 1000, and the client also has the same ETAG value of 1000 cached. However, due to a power loss and subsequent restart (with no stored ETAGs in persistent storage), the random number generator returns 1, which is the same as the previous run. Meanwhile, another client updates the resource at the exact same time as the previous run but modifies a different property, resulting in an ETAG of 1000 for that resource.

The initial client, without knowledge of the resource modification made by the second client, sends a request to access the resource using the previously cached ETAG value of 1000. The device responds with a `VALID` code, indicating that the ETAG remains valid. Nonetheless, the first client remains unaware that the resource has been altered by another client, and the device's resource continues to possess the same ETAG.

```c
static uint64_t g_etag;

static uint64_t etag_random() {
    return (oc_random_value()%1000)+1;
}

void oc_etag_init()
{
    g_etag = oc_clock_time() + etag_random();
}

// Get new ETAG for changed resource
uint64_t oc_etag_get(void)
{
    uint64_t now = oc_clock_time();
    if (now > g_etag)
    {
        g_etag = now;
    }
    g_etag = g_etag + etag_random();
    return g_etag;
}

// Load ETAGs from storage and clear storage
bool oc_etag_load_and_clear()
{
    uint64_t loaded_etags[OC_MAX_APP_RESOURCES];
    bool ok = oc_etags_load(&loaded_etags);
    oc_etag_clear_storage();
    if (!ok)
    {
        return false;
    }
    uint64_t etag = oc_clock_time();
    for (int i = 0; i < num_loaded_etag; ++i)
    {
        if (etag < loaded_etags[i])
        {
            etag = loaded_etags[i];
        }
    }
    // Reinitialize global ETAG value if it can be less than loaded ETAGs
    g_etag = etag + etag_random();

    // Set ETAG for all resources
    for (/*resources in device*/)
    {
        if (/*ETAG is in loaded_etags*/)
        {
            oc_resource_set_etag(resource, etag);
        }
        else
        {
            oc_resource_set_etag(resource, oc_etag_get());
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Updating ETAG on the Device

There are two methods for updating the ETAG when a resource changes:

- `oc_notify_resource_changed`: This function internally triggers `oc_notify_observers` for the observable resource and `oc_resource_update_etag`.
- `oc_resource_update_etag`: This function updates the ETAG without informing observers about the change in content. It can be beneficial for resources that are not observable.

### ETAG Usage by Clients

In order to improve network traffic efficiency, clients have the option to store received ETAGs from GET responses in a cache. To determine if the ETAG is still valid, the client can send the ETAG in a request to the device. If the ETAG is valid, the device will respond with a `VALID` code and no body. If the ETAG is not valid, the device will respond with a `CONTENT` code containing the current ETAG and the corresponding body.

{{< note >}}
For OCF interfaces, the ETAG remains unaffected even if different representations of the resource are available, except for the batch interface (`oic.if.b`). The ETAG is specifically tied to the state of the resource itself, regardless of the interface used.
{{< /note >}}

### ETAG Batch interface for /oic/res

When accessing the `/oic/res` resource, the ETAG represents the highest ETAG value among all the device resources in that collection. If multiple resources within the collection undergo simultaneous changes, the ETAG will be set to the highest value among all the modified resources.

If a client sends a GET request with an ETAG that matches the highest ETAG value among all the resources, the response will consist of a `VALID` code without a body. However, if the ETAG provided by the client does not match the highest ETAG value, the response will include a `CONTENT` code along with the content of all the resources and the highest ETAG value among them.

### Loading and Dumping ETAGs

During device startup, the device developer loads the ETAGs using `oc_etag_load_and_clear` and clears the existing storage. Additionally, when properly shutting down IoTivity-lite, the ETAGs are stored in the storage using `oc_etag_dump`. Improper shutdown results in the ETAGs not being stored, leading to their absence upon restart. The device developer should call `oc_etag_load_and_clear` after creating all resources and before the first run by calling `oc_main_poll_v1`, and `oc_etag_dump` before calling `oc_main_shutdown`.

```c
int ret = oc_main_init(&handler);
...
// Create all custom resources
...
oc_etag_load_and_clear();
while (!quit)
{
    oc_clock_time_t next_event_mt = oc_main_poll_v1();
    ...
}
oc_etag_dump();
...
// Remove all custom resources
...
oc_main_shutdown();
```

### Edge Cases

1. **Time Synchronization**: Maintaining accurate time synchronization is crucial for generating correct epoch time used in ETAGs. Inconsistent system clock synchronization between the device and client can lead to ETAG conflicts. To address this, if the epoch time is less than the global ETAG, the global ETAG is used as a mitigation strategy. A random number is added to the global ETAG as described in the [ETAG Generation Algorithm](#etag-generation-algorithm) to ensure uniqueness.
2. **Storage Failure**: In the event of ETAG storage failure, the loss of ETAG information can result in inconsistencies when determining resource modification. To mitigate this issue, the device developer should carefully check the return value from the `oc_etag_dump` function to confirm the success of the operation. Storage failures often occur due to insufficient storage space.
3. **ETAG Reset**: When a system restarts without a proper dump or due to a power outage, the global ETAG stored in memory is lost. To mitigate this, the ETAGs are not loaded through the `oc_etag_load_and_clear` function, which requires the client to resynchronize with the device to establish a new global ETAG.
4. **Absence of Resources after Device Reboot**: ETAGs for non-existing resources are taken into account when calculating the global ETAG during the `oc_etag_load_and_clear` process. This ensures that ETAGs assigned to previous resources are not reused by new resources, thereby avoiding conflicts and maintaining consistency.
5. **Addition of Resources after Device Reboot**: When new resources are added after a device reboot, the ETAG is set using the algorithm described in the [ETAG Generation Algorithm](#etag-generation-algorithm). This ensures proper tracking of changes for the newly added resource and maintains synchronization with the global ETAG.
6. **Global ETAG Overflow**: In the event that the global ETAG reaches its maximum value and overflows, all resource ETAGs must be reinitialized. This prevents potential conflicts and ensures the continued accurate tracking of resource changes.

In order to monitor resource changes and determine if a resource has been modified on the device, the CoAP gateway utilizes the Entity Tag (ETAG) mechanism.

For **Batch Observation**, the ETAG is associated with the overall state of resources. Prior to initiating resource observation, the CoAP gateway retrieves the latest ETAG among all device resources from the Hub Database. When initiating the resource observation, the CoAP gateway sends the ETAG to the device. If the received ETAG matches the highest ETAG among the device resources, the device responds with a code `VALID`. However, if the received ETAG does not match, the device responds with a code `CONTENT` and includes the current ETAG. Consequently, when a resource changes, the device sends the updated ETAG back to the CoAP gateway via a notification. The CoAP gateway transmits the ETAG together with the Content by using the `NotifyResourceChanged` method to the resource-aggregate. This command is then converted into a `ResourceChanged` event, which is saved in a database and distributed through the event bus. In cases where multiple resources change simultaneously, the CoAP gateway updates all affected resources with the same timestamp and ETAG.

The special query to the database efficiently retrieves the latest ETAG value from all device resources without loading the complete set of data. This optimized query solely focuses on performance and retrieves only the required ETAG value, excluding any additional information.

{{< note >}}
To enable batch observation in IoTivity-lite, you need to activate it using the CMake option `-DOC_DISCOVERY_RESOURCE_OBSERVABLE_ENABLED=ON`.
{{< /note >}}

{{< tip >}}
To identify the resource responsible for updating the ETAG during batch observation, you can refer to the device's debug logs. To enable the device debug logs, use the `-DOC_DEBUG_ENABLED=ON` flag, and set the filter function using [oc_log_set_function](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite/blob/6a12a6e2bd30552ac77274805f95945efd79a1c8/include/oc_log.h#L181-L191).
