Updating firmware on IoT devices is a crucial aspect of maintaining security and functionality. The Software Update Resource, defined by the Open Connectivity Foundation's (OCF) [Core Optional Framework specification, section 5.3.5](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Core_Optional_Specification_v2.2.5.pdf#page=25), plays a crucial role in managing software updates for devices. It enhances the existing manual software update mechanism outlined in ISO/IEC 30118-2, offering additional functionalities and features for a more robust update process.

This resource introduces the ability to:

- **Specify the source of the software package**: Devices can now define the origin of the software package, enabling secure and controlled updates.

- **Schedule time-based software update actions**: It provides the capability to schedule software update actions at specific dates and times, offering flexibility and control over the update process.

- **Provide detailed status information**: The Software Update Resource enriches the update mechanism by offering comprehensive insights into various error situations, allowing for better management of update-related issues.
