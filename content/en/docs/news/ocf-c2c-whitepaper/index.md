An interoperable IoT platform needs to support multiple communication protocols and be secure by default, as well as resilient, scalable and support multitenancy. Reference implementation "plgd" (pronounced "plugged"), available at <https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub>, is a cloud-native IoT platform which fulfils the above needs and more.

This and much more was written by the [Open Connectivity Foundation](https://openconnectivity.org) about us in just recently published [OCF UCI white paper](https://openconnectivity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OCF-UCI-White-Paper_October-2020.pdf)!
