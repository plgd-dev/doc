This service is used to sign identity certificates for devices and [plgd-dev/device](https://github.com/plgd-dev/device) client.

Initialization of the SDK requires an Identity Certificate issued by this service after successful user authorization. The SDK is then able to discover and configure the ownership as described [here](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Security_Specification_v2.2.3.pdf#page=37). During this process, a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is sent to the Certificate Authority which returns device's Identity Certificate.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/plgd-dev/hub/certificate-authority:latest
```

## YAML Configuration

A configuration template is available on [certificate-authority/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub/blob/main/certificate-authority/config.yaml).

{{< note >}}

Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
