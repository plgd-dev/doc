Snippet service is used to automatically update resources in the device when conditions are satisfied or on-demand by the user.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/plgd-dev/hub/snippet-service:latest
```

## YAML Configuration

A configuration template is available on [snippet-service/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub/blob/main/snippet-service/config.yaml).

{{< note >}}

Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
