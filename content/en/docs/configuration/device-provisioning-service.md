The Device Provisioning Service provides API to provision device to the [plgd/hub](https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub).

## Docker Image

Before you use the image you need to setup [K8s access to private registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/plgd-dev/device-provisioning-service/device-provisioning-service:latest
```

{{< tip >}}

You might have one client, but multiple APIs registered in the OAuth2.0 Server. What you might want to prevent is to be able to contact all the APIs of your system with one token. This audience allows you to request the token for a specific API. If you configure it to myplgdc2c.api in the Auth0, you have to set it here if you want to also validate it.

{{< note >}}

Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
