### Public Configuration

These configurations are `CoAP Cloud Conf` information for device registration to plgd hub as well as root CA certificate, certificate authority address to get identity certificate for ssl connection to plgd hub before device registration.
This will be served by HTTP Gateway API as defined [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub/blob/main/http-gateway/uri/uri.go#L14) and also see [hub-configuration](https://try.plgd.cloud/.well-known/configuration).

{{< note >}}

Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
