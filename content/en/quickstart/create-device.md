This guide will walk you through the process of starting your secure [OCF Device](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Device_Specification_v2.2.3.pdf) using [IoTivity](https://iotivity.org/) library on the Raspberry Pi.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi board with a microSD card with [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)
- Optional: HDMI monitor and cable, USB keyboard and mouse for the Pi
- Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection between a DHCP-enabled network and the Pi
- Personal computer(Linux/MacOS recommended) on the same network as the Pi

## Setting up the Raspberry Pi
To set up your Raspberry Pi, please follow [this step-by-step tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up).

### Enable SSH via the Desktop:

1. Launch 'Raspberry Pi Configuration' from the 'Preferences' menu
2. Navigate to the 'Interfaces tab'
3. Select 'Enabled' next to 'SSH'
4. Click 'OK'


![Interfaces] (https://plgd.dev/images/quickstart/pi-configuration-interfaces.png)

### Or enable SSH via `raspi-config` on the terminal:

1. Enter 'sudo raspi-config' in a terminal window
2. Select 'Interfacing Options'
3. Navigate to and select 'SSH'
4. Choose 'Yes'
5. Select 'Ok'
6. Choose 'Finish'


## Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH
More information how to access Raspberry Pi remotely can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md).

```shell script
ssh pi@{raspberryPiIpAddress}  
```

## Install essential build tools
```shell script
sudo apt-get update & apt-get install build-essential git curl openssl
```

## Install IoTivity Cloud Server example 
1. Checkout [IoTivity-Lite](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite):
    ```shell script
    # execute commands on the Raspberry Pi
    git clone -b plgd.dev https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite.git --recursive
    cd iotivity-lite
    ```

2. Build Cloud Server example:
    ```shell script
    cd port/linux
    make CLOUD=1 SECURE=1 MNT=1 cloud_server 
    ```   

3. Run Cloud Server example in the iotivity-lite folder:
    ```shell script
    ./cloud_server 
    ```
    
Now, the Cloud Server example running on your Raspberry Pi allows you to discover your device and connect it to the plgd cloud.
