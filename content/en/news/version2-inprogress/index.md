We are receiving many questions about the ongoing plgd activities. If you are looking at the master branch, you might be asking why we didn't commit anything for the last weeks?

It's because we are havily working on the **plgd cloud 2.0**!
There will be more detailed post about new features and changes, but to give you some insights into what you can expect:
- rapid memory optimization
- optimized device connection handling
- new event store model designed together with the MongoDB team
- optimized database writes and commands handling
- service configuration in YAML files
- deployment using a HELM chart
- plgd Dashboard

and much more ...

We are looking forward to reach this milestone and provide you even more stable and performant plgd cloud!
