Resource Aggregate translates commands to events, stores them to the database and publishes them to the messaging system.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/resource-aggregate:latest
```

## YAML Configuration

A configuration template is available on [resource-aggregate/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/hub/blob/main/resource-aggregate/config.yaml).

> Note that the string type related to time (i.e. time, timeout) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
