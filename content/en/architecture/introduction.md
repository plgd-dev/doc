> The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is the network of physical devices, which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity for the purpose of enabling these things to connect and exchange data. Thus creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits and reduced human intervention. _(Wikipedia, Internet of Things)_

In other words, an IoT device is regularly subject to change, since it represents the world around it. It's up to the developer, how the world is represented through the device and processed by the application for your specific domain.  Technology should support the transfer of data in a standardized and secured way. The IoT platform can't limit you and can't set boundaries, which would limit evolution of your system.

**Domain** is a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity.

IoT itself is most likely not a domain of your business, it is a group of technology achievements from the last decades of the 20th century, which open the door to new possibilities for your business domain.  Allowing for the modelling of the external world specific to your needs, in the form of resources and events, which will be transferred in a secure and traceable manner to your application, located off-premise or even on-premise.  The goal is for developers to focus primarily on the domain of their business.

## Architectural Drivers

### Technical Contraints

- **CoAP**
  - OCF mandates [CoAP](https://coap.technology/) support for compliant [devices](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite).
- **CoAP over TCP**
    While UDP may be preferred for messaging over local networks where "chattiness" is highly detrimental due to power or bandwidth constraints, CoAP over TCP is preferred for situations where a device is communicating with a remote server due to the greater QoS guarantees and TCP has substantially better support than UDP in cloud native use cases.
- **TLS**
    Solution has to provide security and data integrity between the new component and a connecting device.
- **CBOR**
    Default media type used in communication between [OCF compliant devices](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite) and components is [CBOR](https://cbor.io/). This format has to be supported by default.

### Quality Attributes

- **Scalable**
    A forecast provided by Ericsson states that there will be around 18 billion IoT devices online in 2022. The system needs to not only be able to handle large scales, but also be able to rapidly scale up and down in response to load.
- **High Availability**
    IoT devices are often crucial to the safety and performance of the system that they’re used in. While these devices may be in inherently low QoS environments, it is the responsibility of the cloud to always be available when the devices need it and otherwise not be the weakest link.
- **Traceable**
    Many users and devices at once can bring a lot of business errors to consuming systems. It is beneficial to track activities within the system for better error solving and future prediction based on similar periodic patterns.
- **Cost Efficient**
    Many future users won't have the knowledge about infrastructure and operations of the whole system. They might not have their own data center for hosting of the solution. This increases the importance of ease of use and cost efficiency. Most cloud providers offer a similar set of services from a functional point of view. A solution should be able to take advantage of these services to save money, alleviating the burden of missing know-how and increasing runtime optimizations.
- **Multitenant**
    Solution providers which have multiple customers should have the ability to use "one" instance of the system for all customers in a secured way. It is important that a client is only able to access the devices it’s authorized to access.

## Domain Decomposition

### Resources Bounded Context

Servers (IoT Devices) which are OCF enabled are represented in the form of **resources**. (similar to REST)  Resources are hosted by a server (IoT Device) and if it is connected to the [plgd cloud](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/), it is able to publish those resources, which should then be accessible "remotely" through this decentralized component. That means, the [plgd cloud](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/) works both as the gateway and the resource directory for all connected and authorized servers / clients.

> To understand more about what a resource is, read chapter 7 - [Resource model](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Core_Specification.pdf)

**Connected server / client can:**

- Publish / Unpublish resources
  - A resource is represented by a URI and properties (resource types and interfaces)
- Browse Resources
  - Browse resources published by servers to the Resource Directory
- Retrieve Resource
  - Resource Bounded context keeps up-to-date representation of each remote resource
- Update resource representation
  - Resource Bounded context propagates each update to the device's resource
- Observe Resource
  - Each change of the resource creates an event to which client or device can be subscribed

### Identities Bounded Context

Only authorized client _(application interested in data)_ connected to the plgd Cloud _(IoT Device)_ is able to perform an action on the device or access device's data. That means, only authorized client and server are able to browse / CRUDN resource published to the Resource Directory.

A server and client are required to successfully sign-up and sign-in right after connecting to the [plgd cloud](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/). During the sign-up process, which can be thought of as a registration, a one time use [authorization code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) is exchange for an access token, which uniquely represents this server / client. Returned access token is used in the sign-in request. Before the server / client is signed in, requests are not forwarded to the plgd system.

The connected server / client belongs to the user who requested the authorization code.
**Connected server / client can:**

- Sign-up
  - Registration to the plgd cloud with a valid authorization code
- Sign-in
  - Authorize connection with provided access token
- Sign-out
